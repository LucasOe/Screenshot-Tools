# Screenshot-Tools
A small tool to make uploading screenshots to steam easier.

## Why use this program?
* To upload images to steam you need to head to ´´´ D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\USER ID\760\remote\GAME ID\screenshots ´´´.
* There you can upload your images as a *.jpg* and then make a copy of the image and add *_vr.jpg* as an ending.
* To make this process simpler I created this tool. Drag and drop your images into the window, the program will convert *.png* to *.jpeg* and create a copy with the *_vr* ending.

## How to use
* Drag and drop the images you want to upload into the programm. The tool will create a new folder where your images are named *converted*. There you will find each image two time as a *.jpg*. 
* Open the screenshot window in Steam and selct "Show on disk". Now move all the converted screenshots you want to upload here.
* Restart Steam
